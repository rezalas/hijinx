# Welcome to Hijinx for Nginx! 
# This configuration file is intended to be included in your Nginx server block.
# It sets up the necessary processing of requests to properly handle Hijinx
# across your instance. 

# Note: Make sure you have the processor module enabled in your Nginx build, 
# otherwise nothing will be added to your blacklist and thus Hijinx will not work.

# Installation:
# 1. Place this file in your Nginx configuration directory (e.g., /etc/nginx/conf.d/)
# 2. Include this file in your server block with: include hijinx-nginx-include.conf;
# 3. Ensure that the Hijinx configuration file is located at /etc/hijinx/hijinx.conf
# 4. Reload Nginx to apply the changes.

#Hijinx log file location for Nginx
hijinx_log_dir /var/log/nginx/hijinx;

# hijinx blacklist file - This file is dynamically updated by the Hijinx processor module
hijinx_blacklist /etc/nginx/hijinx/blacklist.txt;

# hijinx threshold - Number of suspicious requests before blacklisting an IP
hijinx_threshold 5;
